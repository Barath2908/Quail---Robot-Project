# Quail-1 Robot Project

This repository documents the development of the Quail-1 quadruped robot. It includes design, CAD models, code, testing procedures, and final demonstrations.

## Project Overview
Our project involved creating a quadruped robot. We designed its mechanical parts, developed its code for movement, and performed several tests for different functionalities. Our final goal was to build a stable, moving robot that could demonstrate modularity and different gait patterns.
